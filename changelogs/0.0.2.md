# DCFlight Framework - Changelog v0.0.2

**Release Date:** January 16, 2025

## 🚀 Major Improvements

### WebView Component Fixes
- **Fixed DCFWebView critical issues**
  - Resolved blank/white screen problems caused by threading violations
  - Fixed main thread enforcement for UI updates and delegate management
  - Improved error handling for failed web content loading
  - Better lifecycle management for web view delegates
  - Enhanced memory management to prevent leaks

### Component Architecture Cleanup
- **Removed unreliable components** to improve framework stability:
  - Removed `DCFUrlWrapperViewComponent` (iOS) and `url_wrapper_view_component` (Dart)
    - Component had fundamental issues with touch forwarding and gesture detection
    - Conflicts in complex view hierarchies made it unreliable
    - **Migration**: Use `DCFGestureDetector` + `url_launcher` for tap-to-open-URL functionality

### Enhanced Component Set
- **Added/Improved critical primitive components**:
  - `DCFWebView` - Native web content rendering with WKWebView
  - `DCFAlert` - Native alert dialogs with customizable actions  
  - `DCFModal` - Enhanced modal behavior with proper backdrop and lifecycle
  - `DCFSegmentedControl` - Native segmented control with icon support
  - `DCFSlider` - Native slider with customizable range and step values
  - `DCFSpinner` - Native activity indicators with size/color customization
  - `DCFDropdown` - Cross-platform dropdown/picker component

### Native Integration Improvements
### Native Integration Improvements
- **Streamlined component registration system**
  - More reliable component initialization and setup
  - Better error handling during native component registration
  - Improved delegate lifecycle management across all components
  - Enhanced memory management to prevent component-related leaks

### Color Management Unification
- **Centralized all color utilities** to use shared `ColorUtilities` from framework layer
- **Removed duplicate `UIColor` extensions** from all primitive components
- All components now use consistent color handling patterns
- Improved color conversion reliability and performance

### Asset Loading Standardization
- **Verified correct asset loading patterns** across all components
- All components use proper Flutter asset bundle lookup
- Enhanced asset resolution for better performance and reliability
- Improved error handling for missing or invalid assets

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### iOS Native Layer
- Fixed critical threading issues in DCFWebView component
- Updated component registration in `dcf_primitive.swift`
- Removed unreliable DCFUrlWrapperViewComponent registration
- Improved error handling and logging across components
- Standardized component initialization and cleanup patterns

### Dart Layer
- Updated component exports to remove unreliable components
- Enhanced API consistency across primitive components
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better component lifecycle management

### Framework Integration
- All primitive components properly integrate with dcflight framework
- Consistent use of shared utilities and patterns
- Enhanced type safety and error handling
- Improved component communication and event handling

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **DCFWebView**: Fixed blank screen, threading violations, and delegate issues
- **Component Registration**: Resolved initialization and cleanup problems
- **Memory Management**: Fixed leaks in component delegation and lifecycle
- **Gesture Detection**: Removed problematic gesture forwarding in complex hierarchies
- **Asset Loading**: Improved error handling for missing assets

## 🔄 Breaking Changes
- **Removed Components:**
  - `DCFUrlWrapperViewComponent` / `url_wrapper_view_component`
    - **Reason**: Fundamental reliability issues with touch handling
    - **Migration**: Use `DCFGestureDetector` + `url_launcher` package instead

## 📚 Documentation
- Updated primitives documentation to reflect current component set
- Removed migration guide (no longer needed for this early release)
- Enhanced API documentation with proper component listings
- Updated examples to show recommended patterns

## ✅ Compatibility
- **iOS:** iOS 13.5+ (unchanged)
- **Flutter:** Compatible with current Flutter stable
- **Dart:** Breaking change only affects removed DCFUrlWrapperView component

## 🎯 Performance Improvements
- Fixed DCFWebView performance issues with proper threading
- Improved memory management across all components
- Better component lifecycle handling
- Enhanced error handling and recovery

**Migration Guide:**
- **DCFUrlWrapperView Users**: Replace with `DCFGestureDetector` + `url_launcher`
  ```dart
  // OLD (removed)
  DCFUrlWrapperView(url: "https://example.com", child: myWidget)
  
  // NEW (recommended)
  DCFGestureDetector(
    onTap: () => launchUrl(Uri.parse("https://example.com")),
    child: myWidget,
  )
  ```
- All other components remain unchanged and fully compatible

**Next Steps:**
- Refer to `/docs/primitives_docs/` for complete primitive documentation
- See `/docs/module_dev_guidelines/` for component development guidelines
- Check updated examples in the template app for best practices
