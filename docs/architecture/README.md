### **2. Performance First**
Architecture designed for optimal performance:
- Minimal bridge calls between native and Dart
- Efficient event propagation
- Smart caching and normalization
- Optimized reconciliation process

### **3. Developer Experience**
Simple, intuitive APIs for component developers:
- Single `propagateEvent()` function for all events
- Automatic event normalization
- Built-in adaptive theming
- Clear documentation and examples

### **4. Future Compatibility**
Architecture designed to evolve:
- Extensible event system
- Flexible theming framework
- Modular component architecture
- Backwards compatibility preservation

## üõ°Ô∏è **Compliance Requirements**

### **Mandatory for All Components**
